# Demo Account



# Built with
 - React
 - Redux
 - React Rpouter DOM
 - API
 - Tailwind css
 

## The learning objective of this project are

- Create react front end app
- Connect react front end app to rails back end
- Use API end point to get data
- Fetch data from the API

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#prerequisites)

### Setup

- ```git https://github.com/KingsleyIbe/movie-booking-app-frontend.git``

- ```cd movie-booking-app-frontend```

### Running The App Locally

- Run `npm install`

- Make sure to run our [React frontend application](https://github.com/KingsleyIbe/movie-booking-app-frontend) first before running the React app so that it takes up the `port 3000`. This is very important as our rails API end point must run on `port 3000` for the API to work.
- Once the back end is runing on `port 3000` then start the react app and you will be prompted to run the server on another port like `port 3001`. You will receive a message in your terminal like this `Would you like to run the app on another port instead? ¬ª (Y/n)`. Please enter `y` so that the react app will start on `port 3001`.
