- Use API endpoint to get data
- Fetch data from the API
 
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#prerequisites)

- ```cd movie-booking-app-frontend```
 
### Backend Project Repo
[Project Repo](https://github.com/KingsleyIbe/movie-booking-app-backend)
 
### Running The App Locally
 
- Run `npm install`
 
- Make sure to run our [Rails backend application](https://github.com/KingsleyIbe/movie-booking-app-backend) first before running the React app so that it takes up the `port 3000`. This is very important as our rails API endpoint must run on `port 3000` for the API to work.
- Once the backend is running on `port 3000` then start the react app and you will be prompted to run the server on another port like `port 3001`. You will receive a message in your terminal like this `Would you like to run the app on another port instead? ¬ª (Y/n)`. Please enter `y` so that the react app will start on `port 3001`.
